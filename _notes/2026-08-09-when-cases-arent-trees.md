Every case management system I've seen treats case relationships as a tree. Parent case, child cases, expand, collapse, done. CaseHub's own `entity-tree` does exactly this — select a case, drill into its sub-cases, view the hierarchy. It works.

Until it doesn't.

Consider a fraud investigation. The bank opens case #4012 for a suspicious wire transfer. During investigation, they discover the same account was flagged six months ago — case #3841, now closed. #4012 doesn't contain #3841 and #3841 doesn't contain #4012. They're peers linked by a shared actor. The investigator needs to see this connection. A tree can't show it — by definition, a tree has one parent per node, and these two cases share no ancestor.

It gets worse. The compliance team supersedes #4012 with a broader investigation, #4087. The old case isn't deleted — it has audit trail, evidence, decisions already recorded. It's superseded. #4012 → #4087 is a "this replaced that" link, not a parent-child link. And when the fraud spans three jurisdictions, a coordination case ties together the per-jurisdiction sub-investigations. That's three different relationship types — supersession, coordination, association — none of which fit a tree.

This is the problem the case dependency graph solves. It renders all active cases and their relationships as a force-directed graph — a layout where connected things cluster together and the overall topology reveals itself. Cases that block each other end up close. Supersession chains become visible. Cross-jurisdiction coordination shows the full picture instead of one branch at a time.

The visual metaphor matters. A tree implies hierarchy — someone is the parent, someone is the child. But "case A blocks case B" has no parent. "Case X supersedes case Y" doesn't nest Y inside X. "Case P coordinates cases Q, R, S across three repos" isn't a sub-case relationship — it's a coordination pattern. Force-directed layout treats all these as what they are: connections between peers, with the physics simulation naturally grouping related cases together.

We built this as a generic blocks-ui component — `<blocks-case-dependency-graph>` — because these relationship patterns aren't domain-specific. Insurance claims supersede each other. Clinical trials coordinate across sites. AML investigations link cases across institutions. The relationship types themselves are extensible through a registry: the component ships with parent-child, supersession, and coordination, but any CaseHub application can register types like `blocks`, `relates_to`, or `implements` with their own visual encoding.

The reference point was gastown-viewer-intent's dependency graph, which already renders exactly this kind of multi-type relationship network for development issues. The CaseHub version uses the same approach — D3 force simulation driving SVG directly — but consumes the platform's `GraphModel` from graph-core and uses the status registry for node colouring. Cases show up in their actual status colours. Edge types get distinct line styles and arrow markers. A toolbar lets you filter by relationship type to isolate what you're investigating, and DOT export gives you the graph in a format any external tool can render.

The `entity-tree` still has its place. For drilling into one case's descendants — its workers, sub-cases, gates — a collapsible tree is the right tool. But for answering "what is connected to what, and how?" across the full landscape of active cases, you need a graph.
